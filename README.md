Personalized hackernews API client. Started as React tutorial [ðŸ““The Road to learn React](https://github.com/the-road-to-learn-react/the-road-to-learn-react). I found it quite useful, so added few tweaks to make it more handy and tailored for my needs. This is also a fully working sandbox project for testing new concepts and patterns used in React. :construction:

## Changelog
- Refactored to hooks (rewrited API calls to custom hook)
- Modularized app

## Used template

The template project is [nano-react-app](https://github.com/adrianmcli/nano-react-app).

Use commands:
- `npm start` â€” This will spawn a development server with a default port of `1234`.
- `npm run build` â€” This will output a production build in the `dist` directory.
